I am a final year PhD candidate from [SEIT lab](https://seit.egr.msu.edu/), department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.msu.edu/), [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). My research is focusing on trustworthy AI and security & privacy, especially threats and safety topics related to Multimodal AI (CCS'22, WiSec'23, RAID'23, MobiCom'24, AsiaCCS'25, USENIX Security'25), voice control systems (NDSS'22), LLM (RAID'23, Arxiv'24), and IoT (MobiCom'20, CNS'24). I am advised by [Dr. Qiben Yan](https://cse.msu.edu/~qyan/). 
<!-- Currently, I am an Multimodal Trustworthy Research Intern at Dolby Laboratories, San Francisco, where I work on music watermarking for privacy and copyrights. -->

Before my PhD career in MSU, I finished my undergraduate from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in China. 

I'm also exploring new opportunities in Research Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or AI engineer roles in the U.S. market. If you'd like to connect, feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuanda-wang-a52663179/) or contact me directly through email.

I am a final year PhD candidate from [SEIT lab](https://seit.egr.msu.edu/), department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.msu.edu/), [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). My research is focusing on machine learning & security and privacy, especially threats and safety topics related to speech AI (CCS'22, WiSec'23, RAID'23, MobiCom'24, ), side-channel attacks (NDSS'22), LLM (RAID'23, ARXIV'24), and IoT (MobiCom'20, CNS'24). My advisor is [Dr. Qiben Yan](https://cse.msu.edu/~qyan/). Currently, I am an AI security research scientist intern in ByteDance, San Jose, where I focus on using LLM to solve security issues in cloud services and firewalls. 

Before my PhD career in MSU, I obtained my BEng from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2016 and MEng from [North China Electric Power Univesity (Beijing)](https://english.ncepu.edu.cn/) in 2019. 

I'm currently exploring new opportunities in Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and Applied Scientist roles within the U.S. market.

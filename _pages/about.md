I am a final year PhD candidate from [SEIT lab](https://seit.egr.msu.edu/), department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.msu.edu/), [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/). My research is focusing on machine learning & security and privacy, especially threats and safety issues related to speech AI (CCS'22, WiSec'23, RAID'23, MobiCom'24, ), side-channel attacks (NDSS'22), LLM safety (RAID'23), and IoT (MobiCom'20, CNS'24). My advisor is [Dr. Qiben Yan](https://cse.msu.edu/~qyan/). My resume is available [here](https://yuandaw.github.io//files/YuandaWang_CV.pdf).  

Before my PhD career in MSU, I obtained my BEng from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2016 and MEng from [North China Electric Power Univesity (Beijing)](https://english.ncepu.edu.cn/) in 2019. 

I'm currently exploring new opportunities in Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, and Applied Scientist roles within the U.S. market. If you'd like to connect professionally, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn or contact me directly through email.
